    <p>Letra <br> <br>  The earth will see our eyes <br>
        Go blank tonight <br>
        The earth will rot away <br>
        Go blank tonight <br> <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        These snakes were your arms <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        You'd make up your mind <br> <br>
        The earth disguised a way <br>
        Don't blink tonight <br>
        The earth will see our eyes <br>
        Don't blink tonight <br> <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        These snakes were your arms <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        You could make up your mind <br> <br>
        No blood, more, more blood <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        These snakes were your arms <br>
        I, I really wish <br>
        You'd make up your mind <b></b>
        Blood, down, more</p>

  <p>Letra <br> <br> In my eyes, indisposed <br>
    In disguises no one knows <br>
    Hides the face, lies the snake <br>
    In the sun, in my disgrace <br>
    Boiling heat, summer stench <br>
    'Neath the black the sky looks dead  <br>
    Call my name through the cream <br>
    And I'll hear you scream again <br> <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    And wash away the rain <br> 
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Won't you come (won't you come) <br> <br>
    Stuttering, cold and damp <br>
    Steal the warm wind, tired friend <br>
    Times are gone for honest men <br>
    And sometimes far too long for snakes <br>
    In my shoes, a walking sleep <br>
    And my youth, I pray to keep <br>
    Heaven sent hell away <br>
    No one sings like you anymore <br> <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    And wash away the rain <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br> <br>
    And wash away the rain <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br> <br>
    Hang my head, drown my fear <br>
    'Til you all just disappear <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    And wash away the rain <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    And wash away the rain <br>
    Black hole sun <br>
    Won't you come <br> <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come (black hole sun, black hole sun) <br>
    Won't you come <br>
    Won't you come</p>

<h2>Alice in Chains - I stay away</h2>

<p>Letra <br> <br> Yeah, I want to travel south this year <br>
    Aaah, Woah, Woah <br>
    Won't prevent safe passage here <br> <br>
    Why you act crazy <br>
    Not an act maybe <br>
    So close a lady <br>
    Shifty eyes shady <br> <br>
    Yeah, hey Yeah, tears that soak  <br>
    A callous heart <br> <br>
    Why you act frightened <br>
    I am enlightened <br>
    Your weakness builds me <br>
    So someday you'll see <br> <br>
    I stay away <br>
    Why you act crazy <br>
    Not an act maybe <br>
    So close a lady <br>
    Shifty eyes shady <br> <br>
    I stay away <br>
    I stay away <br>
    I stay away <br>
    I stay away</p>
